Monuments of the Monastical and Cathedral Chureh of

Durham.²l

“These two Bishops (Skirlaw and Langley) were the two
first founders and builders of the said cloisters, arrd did bear all
the charges of the building and workmanship of the said work,
and were the first that did cause, from the cloister door to thc
ehurch door, to be set in glass in the window, the whole story
and miracles of that holy man St. Cuthbert‚ from the day of
his birth to his dying day. And there you might have seen
his mother lying in her child-bed, and how that after she was
delivered thebrightbeams did shine from heaven unto her,
aud upon the child as he lay in the cradle, insomuch that to
every man’s thinking the Holy Ghost had overshadowed him;
sor every one that did see it thought that the house had been
all on fire, the beams did shine so bright over all the house
both within and without, and the bislrop baptised the child,
and called him Yulloch in the Irish tongue, in English Cuth-
bert. The bislrop’s name who baptized and had the keeping of
the virtuous and godly child was called Eugcnius. The name
of the city where St. Cuthbert was baptised was Hardbrecunb,
for he was blessed of God even from his mother's womb. So

that every miracle that he did after from his infancy was setin

the said windows hy itself, and under every miracle there were
certain verses in latine, declaring the contents and meaning
thereos, in most excellent coloured glass most artificially set
forth and curiously wrought.--·In the time of King Edward
the sixth this story was pull’d down by Dean Horn and broken
all to pieces, for he could never abide any ancient monuments,
acts or deeds that gave any light of or to godly religion.''
