of “ oulde angells'’ offered by our friend above to supply
tbe deficiency, we should be unsuccessful, as we know of
no other copy os the manuscript.

A third Poetical Life <the Irish Lise in verse) has
been mentioned above, and a fourth is preserved in one
of the manuscripts bequeathed by Sir Matthew Hale to
the Library of Lincoln’s lnn.

The transcript of the Life now printed was obligingiy
made sor the Society by Mr Henry Turner, one of its
members 3 and the respectful thanks of the Society are
due to the Master and Fellows of University College
for the loan of the manuscript for this purpose.

IV. The short Liie of Eata, Bishop of Hermam, is
contained in the York manuscript above mentioned, and
as it is materially different from the Lite of this prelate

printed in Capgrave‚ it hasbeen thought worthy of a
place in these pages. Capgrave’s Lives are in fact mere
abridgments, and in some instances his anxiety sor corn-
pression has led him to reject matter of importance.
