113 Cells or dependent Monasteries‚ in order 10 repent
at leisure of his 31113, and prosecute his literary designs
(p. 39-40). He seems to have taken up his abode at
Tynemouth in the year 1111, 101 he was resident there
on themidos September in that year (p. Q8)‚ audit
does not appear 11131 he was present at the Translation of
Oswin, which took place in the year preceding. Whilst
resident at T ynemouth he was attached with the gout,
and we should have known nothing of his sufferings un·
der this disease, had 110 not believed it to have been re·

Oswin. He brings his history down to the reign of
Stephen, and therefore he must have lived to a con·

'The first part of his Work is a compilation, chiefly
from Bede.

His style is pleasing, and he enters with considerable
vigour, and occasionally with humour, 11110 some 01 his
tales, and details many very curious historical circum·
stances and local 0101113, which but for him would have
been buried in oblivion.

A pleasing memorial 01 the piety 01 King Oswin, the

contained the inscription “Liber Oswini Regis.'’ From
the portions which remain it seems to belong to Oswin’s
period. Itis 01 the duodecimo size, and therefore tho
more adapted to daily use.
