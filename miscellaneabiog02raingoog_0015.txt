There is, in the Britislr Museum,(T1rus, A. 11. 2.
3.) another copy 01 this lrish Life ol Cuthbert‚ as it
hasbeen called, with a translation into Leonine verse.
The latter begins with the following lines :—

“Si cupis audire, Cuthberti miraquescire
Virtutis mirae, potes hunc sanctum reperire.
Sanctus Cuthbertus Anglorum tutor apertus
Regis erat natus et Hybernicus est generatus, &c.’'

The Pocm‚ however, is imperfect. A note at the
loot os 101. 151. h. discloses this defect, and expresses
the great anxiety of its owner 011 the subject. “ Hear
wants fyve leaves for whiche Iwold gev fyve oulde
angells.'' The Poem ends as follows :-·

‘⁶ Duru precibus caris devotus eum veneraris.
Terras Cuthherti qui non spoliare verentur,
Esse queant certi quod morte rnala morientur.''

There appears to be another copy os this same Poeti-
cal Life in the MS. Harl. 4843, s. 261.

ΙΙΙ. The next piece, the Lile ol St. Cuthbert in sirn-
ple Leonines,* is transcribed frorn a manuscript [l. 21.
165] belonging to the Master and Fellows ol University
College, Oxford, written about the end of the 1ch or

beginning of the 18th century, and containing, besideS,
1. Bede's Prose Life of St. Cuthbert.

’⁹‘ See acurious cssay, in which this kind of verse is fully described, in u
“Tractatus incerti Auctoris de Metro'' appended to the Itirrerary of Wil-
liam de Worceslre, publislred by Nusnrith3 Cumb. 1778.
